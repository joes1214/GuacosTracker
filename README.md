# Guaco's Tracker
First major project using C# and ASP.NET. 

## What is Guaco's Tracker?
**Guaco is a professional at tracking support tickets!**

Main features of this program:
 - Utilizes Auth0
 - Three different user groups exist: Employee, Manager, and Admin
 - Each group can perform different important actions. Namely edit and delete existing tickets
 - Every ticket can be given notes to give further context with every update

TODO:
 * Add Searching capabilites
 * Improve database functionality
 * Customizable settings
 * _These are all I can think of_

## Authentication
In order to create a safe and secure login, I used [Auth0](https://auth0.com/) to handle authentication, authorization, and role management.
