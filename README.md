# Guaco's Tracker
This is my first major project using C# and ASP.NET. 

## What is Guaco's Tracker?
It is a ticket tracker. Guaco's Tracker features 3 different models: 
* Customer
* Ticket
* Note

All of these hold important information one would need to keep track and organize their needs.

## Authentication
In order to create a safe and secure login, I used [Auth0](https://auth0.com/) to handle authentication, authorization, and role management.
